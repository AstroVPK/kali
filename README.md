# libcarma
A library to model a time series as a Continuous-time ARMA (C-ARMA) process.
Version: 1.0.0

Install
-------
Install instructions are provided for linux machines. The following OSs have been tested--
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr

You will need to have the Intel C++ Compiler XE installed along with Intel MKL and NLOpt. At the moment, all 
three are required though the plan is to eventually allow the use of g++ etc...

1. Intel C++ Compiler XE
The Intel C++ compiler is included in the Intel速 Parallel Studio XE Composer Edition (and higher editions).

  [Try & Buy](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-parallel-studio-xe/try-buy#buynow)

  Students are eligible for a free license. Greatly discounted pricing is available for academic users. Use of 
the Intel compiler results in the largest performance gains on Intel architectures. To install the Intel 
compiler, download the Parallel Studio XE edition of your choice by following the instructions at 
https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/student (Student + free Compiler & MKL)
https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/academicresearcher (Academic Resercher + free MKL)
Unpack the tarball as usual and then change to the top-level directory of the un-tarred folder. In the 
terminal type


bash-prompt$ sudo install_GUI.sh


to start the install. Add the following line to your .bashrc to setup the necessary environment variables 
required by the compiler.


source /opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries/linux/bin/compilervars.sh intel64


This software has been tested with


Intel速 Parallel Studio XE 2016 Cluster Edition Update 1 16.0.1.150 / 20151021(icpc version 16.0.1 (gcc version 4.8.0 compatibility)

2. Intel MKL Library
The Intel MKL library is a high performance math library that is used extensively in this package. Since the 
library can be obtained free of cost by both students as well as academic researchers, there is no plan to 
replace it with an alternative. Intel MKL may be obtained from
https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/student (Student + free Compiler & MKL)
https://software.intel.com/en-us/qualify-for-free-software/academicresearcher (Academic Resercher + free MKL)
This software has been tested with
Intel速 Math Kernel Library 11.3

3. NLOpt
NLOpt is a free/open-source non-liner optimization library written by the AbInitio Group at MIT.
Steven G. Johnson, The NLopt nonlinear-optimization package, http://ab-initio.mit.edu/nlopt 
NLOpt can be downloaded from 
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt
After un-tarring the tar file, NLOpt should be installed as follows
bash-prompt$ ./configure --enable-shared
bash-prompt& make
bash-prompt$ sudo make install
This software has been tested with
Version 2.4.2
